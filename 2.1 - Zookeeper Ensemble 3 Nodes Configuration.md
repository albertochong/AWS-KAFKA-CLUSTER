# Set the port to something non-conflicting if choosing to enable this
admin.enableServer=false
# admin.serverPort=8080

Name/Value   | Description
------------ | -------------
dataDir=/opt/zookeeper/data/ | the directory where the snapshot is stored
dataLogDir=/opt/zookeeper/logs/ | To get low latencies on updates it is important to have a dedicated transaction log directory. By default transaction logs are put in the                                         same directory as the data snapshots and myid file. The dataLogDir parameters indicates a different directory to use for the transaction logs
